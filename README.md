<h1>berry-pie-1</h1>
<p>This is a repository for both the "verybery" (terrain) and "berrypie" (wildfire) entries to the Astro Pi competition.</p>
<h3>berrypieWildfireAnalysisCode</h3>
<p>This contains code which plots the latitude and longitude of each image, corresponding to a color which corresponds to the category that the Coral AI classified them as. If you click on one it will display the image that the Coral AI classified, although this will not work as the images are not committed.</p>
<h3>veryberyTerrainAnalysisCode</h3>
<p>This is very similar, it contains extremely similar code within the "showOnMap" folder, but also contains the "accuracyPercentage" folder, which has a python script that calculates the percentage accuracy.</p>
<h3>old</h3>
<p>Please ignore this, it contains the code submitted in earlier stages, as well as code used to test/train the coral AI. However, it is irrelevant to the analysis.</br></br></br>ice-cube-1</p>
