<h1>Berry-pie-1</h1>
<p>This is a repository for both the "verybery" (terrain) and "berrypie" (wildfire) entries to the Astro Pi competition.</p>
<h3>berrypieWildfireAnalysisCode</h3>
<p>This contains code which plots the latitude and longitude of each image, corresponding to a color which the Coral AI classified them as. If you click on one it will display the image that the Coral AI classified, although this will not work as the images are not committed.</p>
<h3>veryberyTerrainAnalysisCode</h3>
<p>Same as the above, but maps the verybery project.</p>
<h3>old</h3>
<p>Please ignore this, it contains the code submitted in earlier stages, as well as code used to test/train the coral AI. However, it is irrelevant to the analysis.</br></br></br>ice-cube-1</p>
